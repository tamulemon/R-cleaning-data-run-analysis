"Tidy data average" dataset
 
=================
There are 68 variables in the table. Each cell contains the mean for a particular variable/activity/subject combination. 
The calculation is based on the data frame "showActivities" generated at the end of the run_analysis.R code, 
by melt-recast functions.

Activities: one of the 6 activities the subject is performing. 
Values are: WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING               

Subject: the ID of the volunteer that takes the action. Value from 1 to 30. 

The following are the feature variables that are included in the final "showActivities" dataset. 
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions. 
- Each feature variable has 2 measurements:
mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
-	Mean is calculated for each direction independently. Mean is also calculated for mean() and std() independently. 
For example:
  tGravityAcc-mean()-X column : stores the mean of the mean of tGravityAcc feature in the X direction.
  tBodyAcc-std()-Z: stores the mean of the standard deviation of tBodyAcc feature in the Z direction.
- “Mag” variable is captured for the magnitude of particular variable. It is not a vector so there is no direction value.
